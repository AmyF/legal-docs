# Privacy Policy for CorpCoreVibe

**Effective Date:** November 11, 2025

Thank you for using CorpCoreVibe (the "App"), developed by me, a personal developer. Your privacy is at the core of the App's design. This policy explains how your information is handled.

## The Core Privacy Principle: I Cannot Access Your Data

I want to be crystal clear: **I do not have access to your personal data.**

All data collected by the App is processed and stored **only on your device**.

If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your **private iCloud account**. This data is synced directly between your devices and is not accessible by me or any third party. I do not operate any servers to collect, store, or process your personal information.

## Information the App Collects

The App "collects" data only in the sense that it reads it from your device or stores it on your device. This includes:

### 1. Health Information (from Apple HealthKit)

With your **explicit permission**, the App reads the following data from the Apple HealthKit database on your device. This data is used *only* for calculation and display within the App:

* **Step Count**
* **Sleep Analysis**
* **Heart Rate**
* **Resting Heart Rate**
* **Heart Rate Variability (HRV SDNN)**

This data is essential for calculating your metrics, such as the "Burnout Index" and "Personality Snapshot".

### 2. Location Information (Geofencing)

With your **explicit "Always" location permission**, the App uses Apple's Geofencing technology to monitor when you enter and exit your designated "WorkLocation".

* This is used *only* to automatically start and stop your "WorkSession" timer to calculate your work duration.
* Your precise location history is not stored or transmitted. The App only reacts to the "enter" and "exit" events.

### 3. User-Provided Information

The App stores data that you manually enter:

* **Mood:** Your subjective mood rating (e.g., `Mood Level`).
* **Energy:** Your subjective energy rating (e.g., `Energy Level`).
* **Work Locations:** The addresses and radii of the locations you designate as "work".

## How I Use Your Information

Your data is used *exclusively* to provide the features of the App:

* To calculate your daily, weekly, and monthly metrics.
* To generate your "Personality Snapshot".
* To check for and award in-app Achievements.
* To display your trends and history *to you* within the App.

**Apple HealthKit Data Requirement:** I am required by Apple to state the following: Your data from HealthKit will **never** be used for marketing, advertising, or data-mining purposes. It is not shared with any third party.

## Data Sharing

I do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any third parties, because I cannot access it in the first place.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. I do not knowingly collect any information from children under 16.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
