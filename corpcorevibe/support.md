## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why isn't the app tracking my work hours?**

A: Automatic tracking relies on "Always" Location access and a configured "Work Location". Please check the following:

1.  **Is your Work Location set up?** Ensure you have added your office in the app's "Settings" > "Work Locations" and that the toggle is enabled.
2.  **Is "Always" permission active?** The app requires "Always" access to respond to geofence events in the background. Please go to: "System Settings" > "Privacy & Security" > "Location Services" > "CorpCoreVibe" and ensure **"Always"** is selected.

**Q: Why is my "Recovery", "Steps", or "Fright" data showing 0 or --?**

A: These metrics rely on Apple HealthKit permissions. Please open the Apple **"Health"** app, then:

1.  Tap your **profile icon** (top-right).
2.  Under "Privacy", tap **"Apps and Services"**.
3.  Tap **"CorpCoreVibe"**.
4.  Ensure you have enabled all requested categories (Steps, Sleep, Resting Heart Rate, etc.) by tapping **"Turn On All"**.

**Q: I got a new phone (or reinstalled the app). How do I get my Pro subscription back?**

A: No problem! Your purchase is tied to your Apple ID. Simply go to the "Settings" tab in the CorpCoreVibe app and tap the **"Restore Purchases"** button. The App Store will verify your purchase history and unlock all Pro features.
