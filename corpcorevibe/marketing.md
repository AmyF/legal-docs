# How Strong is Your "Work Vibe"?

Welcome to "Work Vibe Detector" (班味检测器) — a passive life logger designed for the "9-to-5" worker.

Say goodbye to manual clock-ins and embrace the dark humor of automatically generated data.

## Free Your Hands: Automatic Work Tracking
Set your "Work Location" once, and the app will *attempt* to record your work start and end times in the background.

## Health Data Integration for Body Insights
"Work Vibe Detector" integrates Apple Health (HealthKit) data to present a series of exclusive "Work Vibe" metrics:
* **Work Vibe Concentration**: Your overall "vibe" score for the day.
* **Last Night's Recovery**: An estimate of your sleep quality.
* **Burnout Index**: Helps you observe the exhaustion level of your "work soul".
* **Desk Activity**: See if you're "desk-bound" or "slacking off" on the clock.
* (And more...)

## Unlock Your "Work Vibe" Persona & Achievements
Are you a "Burnout Zombie" or a "Pro Slacker"? The app will *attempt* to generate your weekly and monthly persona report.

In the "Hall of Achievements," record your highlight (and overwork) moments.

## Your Data Belongs to You
All data is stored on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We will not read or share any of your records.

## Unlock Pro for the Full Vibe Insight
"Work Vibe Detector" offers core features for free. Upgrade to Pro (an auto-renewing subscription) to unlock all current "In-Depth Insights" charts, including:
* Vibe Trend
* Burnout Trend
* "Jet Lag" Index
* Life Composition
* Daylight Index
* Leisure Freedom
* ...and all future Pro features.
